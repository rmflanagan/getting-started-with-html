<h1>The Basics of the Web & HTML</h1>

<b>Basics of the Web</b>
<p>The world wide web is comprised of a large collection of <em>HTML documents</em>. These documents are connected to each other by <em>hyper links</em>. HTML documents may contain plain text, html, images, videos and/or music.
</p>
<p>The main components of the web are you, the <em>user</em>, your computer with its <em>web browser</em>, the <em>internet</em> and <em>servers</em>. The user goes to a web page (e.g. http://www.google.com) and your browser sends an http request via the internet to servers; these servers respond to these requests by locating the appropriate page(s) and displaying it back on your web browser. <a href=https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer/#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/e-48329854/m-48480496>This video</a> contains a visual representation of these web component relationships.</p>

<b>HTML</b>
<p>HTML is an abbreviation of <em>hypertext markup language</em>. HTML is comprised of <em>text content</em>, or what the user sees, <em>markup</em>, or how the user sees it, <em>references</em> to other documents, such as images or videos, and finally <em>links</em> to other pages. <a href=https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer/#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/m-48724340>This video</a> gives an HTML overview.</p>

<b>HMTL Tags/Elements</b>
<p>HTML markup is written as <em>elements</em> that describe how contents are displayed in a document. To write these elements, we use HTML <em>tags</em>. <a href=https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer/#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/m-48723444>This video</a> shows the structure of tags. Examples of basic tags are those used for displaying bold text (<em>b</em> for bold) and italic text (<em>em</em> for emphasis).</p>

<b>A "Smart" Aside about "Stupid" Computers</b>
<p>Computers are "stupid" in the sense that they can only literally translate programming code. They cannot interpret what a programmer intended, and are therefore unable to correct mistakes programmers make. Even small errors in code can lead to large problems in the rendered results.</p>

<b>HTML Attributes</b>
<p>Some HTML tags have <em>attributes</em>, which use an additional value in the opening tag. An example is the <em>anchor</em> tag, as described in <a href= "https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer/#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/e-48508417/m-48723411ref"> this video</a>, that uses the attribute "href" to turn text into a link to another page. A further example is the image tag, that contains the attribute value "scr" to display an image file.</p>

<b>Another Aside about Remembering</b>
<p>It's important to note that even experienced programmers don't remember how to code everything, as there is simply <em>too much</em> to remember! If you forget how to do something, a simple online search will typically give you the answer you need.</p>

<b>Inline/Block Elements</b>
<p>HTML elements are classified as either <em>inline</em> or <em>block</em>. Inline elements are just text, whereas block elements create an "invisible box" around text. <a href=https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer/#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/m-48723438>This video</a> uses the break and paragraph tags to describe the distinction between inline and block tags.</p>

<b>Container Elements</b>
<p><em>Container</em> elements simply "contain" whatever is found within them. The example given in <a href=https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer/#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/e-48756004/m-48748018>this video</a> is "span", an inline element, and "div", a block element.</p>

<b>HTML Document Structure</b>
<p>HTML documents need doctype, html, head and body tags. Doctype has been simplified since the use of html5. The head section may contain things such as the document meta-data, CSS styling elements and the title of the page. The body section contains the actual text of the page. <a href=https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer/#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/m-48748025>This video</a> has a visual representation of the structure of HTML documents.</p>
